## 🎓 Bachelor Thesis  
**Title:** Development of a Reference Application for the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG)  

**Author:** Dominic Kronig 

**Institution:** University of Bern, Software Engineering Group 

**Year:** 2025

## 📖 Overview
The **OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG)** is an industry-standard manual for assessing the security of mobile applications.  
Despite its wide adoption, there is **no unified reference app** that demonstrates its test cases in a practical, hands-on way.  

This project addresses that gap by providing a **reference Android application** that intentionally includes a (hopefully) diverse set of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations corresponding to the categories outlined in the MASTG, such as:  

- 🔓 Insecure data storage  
- 🧑‍💻 Weak authentication  
- 📡 Insecure communication  
- 🛠️ Reverse engineering issues  
- 🐞 Runtime and static vulnerabilities  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- 📚 Serve as a **practical companion** to the MASTG  
- 🧪 Provide a **safe environment** for mobile penetration testing practice  
- 🛡️ Support **academic teaching** and **industry training**  
- 📊 Map implemented vulnerabilities to the **MASTG test catalog**  

---

## 📂 Deliverables
- 📱 **Open-source Android app(s)** with representative vulnerabilities  
- 📑 **Thesis documentation** including:  
  - State of the art in Android vulnerability detection  
  - Comparison with existing intentionally vulnerable apps  
  - Design & implementation details  
  - Didactic evaluation and mapping to MASTG test cases  
- 🎤 **Presentation (& demo?)** of findings

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This application is **intentionally insecure** and must **not** be used in production.  
It is designed **only for research, teaching, and security testing purposes** in controlled environments.
