**Bachelor Thesis**  
**Title:** Development of a Reference Application for the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG)

## Description: 
The OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) is an industry-standard manual for assessing the security of mobile applications. It provides a comprehensive catalog of test cases and best practices for identifying vulnerabilities in Android applications. While the guide is widely used in both academia and industry, there is currently a lack of a unified reference application that demonstrates its concepts in a practical, hands-on way.

The goal of this thesis is to design and implement a mobile application that serves as a reference implementation for the MASTG. The application will intentionally include a diverse set of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations corresponding to the categories and test cases outlined in the guide (e.g., insecure data storage, weak authentication, insecure communication, reverse engineering issues). The app or apps will serve as a practical companion to the MASTG, enabling students, researchers, and practitioners to practice mobile penetration testing in a safe and controlled environment.

The student will:
- Familiarize themselves with the OWASP MASTG and its test categories.
- Design one or more mobile applications (Android or cross-platform) that incorporates representative vulnerabilities across multiple categories.
- Document each vulnerability in the app/apps with reference to the corresponding MASTG test case.
- Provide clear instructions and examples on how the vulnerabilities can be detected and exploited using manual testing scripts or common mobile security testing tools.
- Evaluate the resulting app/apps as a didactic tool by mapping implemented vulnerabilities to the MASTG test catalog.

## Expected Outcome:
A fully functional, open-source reference application/applications with accompanying documentation that demonstrates a broad set of vulnerabilities described in the OWASP MASTG. The app/apps can be used as a teaching resource for mobile application security testing, supporting both academic courses and industry training. The app/apps should include static and runtime vulnerabilities.

## Deliverables  
- An open-source Android app/apps that implements a set of vulnerabilities for the MASTG that can be used as reference app. 
- A **written thesis** that documents:  
  - The state of the art in vulnerability detection for Android.  
  - Comparison with existing intentional vulnerable Android apps.
  - The design and implementation of the developed Android app.  
- A presentation and demonstration of the developed app and findings.
